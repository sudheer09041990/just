DECLARE @current VARCHAR(500);
DECLARE @start VARCHAR(500);
DECLARE @indx INT;
SELECT @current = path
FROM sys.traces
WHERE is_default = 1;
SET @current = REVERSE(@current)
SELECT @indx = PATINDEX('%\%', @current)
SET @current = REVERSE(@current)
SET @start = LEFT(@current, LEN(@current) - @indx) + '\log.trc';
-- CHNAGE FILER AS NEEDED
SELECT CASE EventClass
WHEN 46 THEN 'Object:Created'
WHEN 47 THEN 'Object:Deleted'
