---- Current disk format is MBR type so they can't increase more than 2 TB so we created new drive with 3 TB with GPT disk Type format 
(Migration of files(contained mdf and ldf and tempdb) from one drive to another new drive
Step 1 : stopped the sql services  
we moved all files(contained mdf and ldf and tempdb) from one drive to another new drive

errors we faced when we are copying all the data, data is getting doubled so we choose to copy files by few files and then few then it got success
2) once all the files are transferred changed the current drive to some other letter and then new drive to Current drive letter
and then we started the services and then all are fine except one database ( it is in suspect mode then we executed the below emergency command
and we got the O errors in the output last line then we execute the below repair command and it came online
