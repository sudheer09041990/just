--- How to check connection issues from user machine to DB server or application machine to db server or from anything to DB server.

---- for SSPI Context and target principal name error we need to set the SPN  and how to fix that ...

https://cmatskas.com/fixing-error-cannot-generate-sspi-context-after-changing-sql-service-account/
Please raise the ticket to TGRC team with the like below commands and if the SQL services are running with the local system account then server name like below if any other process account then replace with account instead of server name of last one (means only end of each command server name not the before one) and ask TGRC iam team to set the DNS
( - A is attribute for adding and - d is for deleting something like that )
 Very IMP to check what is SPN's configured just open the windows power shell and setspn -l servername(hostname)
and you need to check what SPN's are configured and then you need to ask TGRC team to execute only remaining commands which are not configured and not all other wise it won't execute properly

and also if the port number is different then replace port number and also we need to check how to configure for servername\ss201a like these instances

setspn -A MSSQLSvc/msuselkgcp3567 msuselkgcp3567
setspn -A MSSQLSvc/msuselkgcp3567:1433 msuselkgcp3567

( how to check the  SPN issue error in sql server logs please check with Siva once and have the details )

------ How to trouble shoot the connection issues and linked server connection issues as well ------
1) Ping the destination server
2)tracert ip destination server
3)telnet ip destination server with SQL port number (like 1433 or what ever configured)
if still there is connectivity issue then check whether UDP Port 1434 is enabled or not between source and destination with network team 
if you received telnet is not recongnized command just go to server manager-> roles and features -> telnet client and install and then try it
but for user machine they need to check with wintel\network\system support team like EUC team
4)when changing the password for linked server account, login to the server and do it , don't connect instance from other server
if any one of above is not working then they need to work with Network\wintel team and for telnet network security team will work with the link form for access issue\granting perissions 
(what is tnsping and how to check it)

--- query to check what processes are running under the user login ------

--- just tip when there are blockings are occuring other than root blocker just concentrate on the login and hostnames so that if we provide to the application team then they can able to know from where these are getting triggered and they can able to stop the jobs if anything is causing the issue ----

---- Listener issue : we need to connect the listener with port number like listnername,portno and if the port id default 1433 then we can directly connect with listener name alone ----

execute the query and check all the CPU's are online or check if any are offline 

SELECT scheduler_id, 
       cpu_id, 
       STATUS, 
       is_online
FROM sys.dm_os_schedulers

if offline then it is like the cpu's are not using by SQL and need to check that instance properties -> processes -> automactially is enabled or not
and it should be enabled so that it can use all processes 
if enabled but still offline means then you need to check the SQL version that supports no of sockets and cores
Example : SQL 2016 supports 4 sockets and some x cores then check the configuration is correct with command msinfo32


-- SPN (Service principal name) issue error resolving steps and just make sure that -d is for deleting commands and the thing is first you need to execute the -A respective commands
what ever are required and then if they got the error that duplicate entry account then we need to delete that by changing the command of -d 
and also the account which is already registered

also the below commands are also with the example servers of having named instance like mssgsingic4049\SS2014A and also different SQL port number other than default 

setspn -d MSSQLSvc/mssgsingic4049.ap.corp.cargill.com mssgsingic4049
setspn -d MSSQLSvc/mssgsingic4049.ap.corp.cargill.com:SS2014A mssgsingic4049
setspn -d MSSQLSvc/mssgsingic4049.ap.corp.cargill.com:61025 mssgsingic4049
setspn -A MSSQLSvc/mssgsingic4049.ap.corp.cargill.com PS235171
setspn -A MSSQLSvc/mssgsingic4049.ap.corp.cargill.com:SS2014A PS235171
setspn -A MSSQLSvc/mssgsingic4049.ap.corp.cargill.com:61025 PS235171
setspn -A MSSQLSvc/mssgsingic4049 PS235171
setspn -A MSSQLSvc/mssgsingic4049:SS2014A PS235171
setspn -A MSSQLSvc/mssgsingic4049:61025 PS235171

setspn -d MSSQLSvc/mssgsingic4049.ap.corp.cargill.com:1433 mssgsingic4049
setspn -a MSSQLSvc/mssgsingic4049.ap.corp.cargill.com:1433 PS235171
setspn -a MSSQLSvc/mssgsingic4049:1433 PS235171

---- Replication loading files size issue then i have executed this query in publisher to resolve 

EXEC sp_configure 'max text repl size', -1 after execution please execute reconfigure 

---- if you found the backups are not running, check the backup account permissions and then check the AG backup prefference if it is secondary then change
it to Primary and then monitor and also no need to stop sql services because it is Commvault tool backup ---

---- to disable the instance in monitoring go to redgate and configuration and select the base monitor and 
also search with only server name and the go to that instance and icon suspend monitoring and till the last instance is 
decommissioned then we can remove monitoring

--- Backup Servername msuselkg4548 to login for commvault requests

----- how to redirect all the read only connections to Secondary database and only update\insert transactions to primary.
Ans : In the connection string we can set as read intent only. also read queue have to set
(https://www.sqlshack.com/how-to-configure-read-only-routing-for-an-availability-group-in-sql-server-2016/)

---- Query to get count value of column ---
SELECT COUNT(*), NTUserName FROM ip_sysadmin_trace_temp GROUP BY NTUserName;

----Migrating\copying\moving data\log\temp db files to other drives ----
before starting this just for safety take the logical name and old path with file names using query.

Temp DB : No need to copy the files just we need to execute the new path commands and restart the servcies for tempdb

Data and LDF : user db's (ldf and mdf) we need to make the db offline and copy the files to the new location and 
execute the commands with updated locations and then make the db online

ALTER DATABASE [Cargill_DBA] MODIFY FILE ( NAME = Cargill_DBA_Data, FILENAME = 'E:\MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Data\Cargill_DBA.mdf');
ALTER DATABASE [Cargill_DBA] MODIFY FILE ( NAME = Cargill_DBA_Log, FILENAME = 'F:\MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Data\Cargill_DBA_log.ldf');

---- if there is any issue when executing commands as that logical name is not picking up and getting error due to then use this braces [] and execute.

else Detach and Attach is also the easiest way by selecting the just we need to select the new path locations.
(if we select the MDF file then automaticall ldf file will be selected if the path is incorrect we can also select the new path)

----- When the below error come you can restart the service as because total instance is un available

pre-login handshake failed , initialization =7038 and handshake=9996

---- just a Tip that, the disk latency should be Milliseconds so then only the I/O is faster means if it is Seconds then definetly storage/OS team has
to look that ----

---- just a Tip, if any perfomacne issue the we need to check the CPU's configuration ( cores and sockets) of the Server.
Example if 4 cores with 2 sockets configuration will not give better perfomance and 4 cores 1 socket will give better perfomance so we need to ensure the 
cores and sockets are configures properly --

--- How to kill all the sleeping sessions on the specicific\single database --

USE [master];

DECLARE @kill varchar(8000) = '';  
SELECT @kill = @kill + 'kill ' + CONVERT(varchar(5), spid) + ';'  
FROM sys.sysprocesses
WHERE  dbid = db_id('db_gdr') and status='sleeping'

EXEC(@kill);

---- if user is having connection failure\issue and getting some "error 40 , could not open a connection to sql server"
then he can try connect with FQDN -----

--- just a tip when the backup's are not running through the backup tools like Commvault..etc then just just ask
to kill the current running jobs from the tool and retry running it again from CV backup's and data\log file drive should not be full , also shrink log file 
if it is more space ----

---- for login issue in AG databases, when failover happens the databases users will only failover.
so we need to make sure the just login should be added in all the secondary nodes and also for any
SQL auth type please check sid is same or not. if not then please create the same ----

--- If the app team having any access issues then check also TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.2 needs to be enabled by changing the value to 1 in the registrey key
and then server reboot is mandatory to effect the changes ----- also they have to update the same in their app servers also and reboot.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols
keys under the Protocols key for both Client and Server subkeys.
SCHANNEL\Protocols\SSL 2.0\Client 
SCHANNEL\Protocols\SSL 2.0\Server
SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.0\Client
SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.0\Server

--- During the weekend there are issues occured for few servers which are auto window patched and the servers are
slow and could see there is svchost.exe is consuming more memory and the issue is resolved after the reboot of servers.
